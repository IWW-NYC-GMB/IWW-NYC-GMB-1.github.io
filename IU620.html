Whether the school is public, private, or charter, we work with PhD candidates 		or preschoolers, we create lesson plans or serve lunch in the cafeteria, we 		as workers in the education industry are the ones who make it all function. 		We are the ones that dedicate our labor power to our students and our communities. 		We carry the weight of future generations on our backs. We are entitled to 		the fruits of our labor. </font></p>	<p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>		2. An injury to one is an injury to all. Our local is all about solidarity 		among our fellow workers. We prioritize campaigns against the racist, sexist, 		and ableist forces and actors in the education industry. The oppressive structures 		that exploit education workers and our students alike can be defeated when 		we, the union, unite is struggle to win back our rights and dignity. </font></p>	<p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>		3. The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. The high-ranking 		administrators, trustees, and bureaucrats need us to make a profit, but we 		do not need them. They will always puts the bottom line above the welfare 		of workers, students, or families.</font></p>	<p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>		4. Business unions such as the American Federation of Teachers are not interested 		in real struggle, because real struggle would bring real, substantive victories. 		Hierarchical, bureaucratic unions would rather act as our insurance companies 		than as bodies to organize our work spaces. We do not need low-level managers 		and representatives to put our demands into complaint boxes at union headquarters.</font></p>	<p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>		5. We are the ones who understand our places of work best, and we should organize 		them as such. Every campus and classroom deserves a democratic and grassroots 		union that aims to fulfill the promises of a good education system. Our schools 		need direct, rank-and-file, bottom-up action if we want our needs to be met. 	</font></p>	<p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 		Industrial Workers of The World in New York City (<a href="iww.org">iww.nyc</a>) 		is organizng all workers in the education industry around our region.<em><strong><font color="#CC0000"> 				</font></strong></em></font><font color="#000000" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 					more information and to get involved, please contact <a href="mailto:organize@iww.nyc">organize@iww.nyc</a>.</font></p></div>
